Project Phase 3 Description:

Objective: Convert the ER model of your project mini-world to a relational model and iteratively normalize the database to reduce redundancy

You are required to submit a snapshot of the relational model at the following stages:
● After mapping ER to relational model

● Relational model after conversion to 1NF

● Relational model after conversion to 2NF

● Relational model after conversion to 3NF

If there is no need to convert to a certain normalized form, mention it in the submission
document(and its justification). In such cases, you are not required to submit the snapshot for
that stage.

Explanations:
You must provide concise explanations for each of the above stages. These explanations should
contain information about the changes made to entity types to reflect the relational mapping.
Note that we do not expect explanations on the individual steps of the process
