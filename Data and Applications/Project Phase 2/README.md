Project Phase 2 Description:

The Task:

Design an ER diagram for your mini-world using the requirements document submitted
earlier.Just like any ER diagram, we expect it to contain information about all entities
(and their attributes) and the relationships they are in as per the requirements
document.

You are free to make minor edits (Please try to keep them to a minimum as the entire
goal of the project is for you to scope out potential issues in the future while designing a
database) to your mini-world. Mention these changes in the submission document as
well
