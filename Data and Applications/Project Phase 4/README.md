Project Phase 4 Description:

This is the final part of the project! Using the previously modeled relational schemas, you must
create and populate the database as per your relational schema in MySQL. You must then build
a command line interface in Python3 to satisfy the functional requirements specified earlier.
This can be done using libraries like PyMySQL.

There are two parts to this project

● Creating the database: You have to create your database according to the relational
model constructed in phase 3. Please make sure to account for all the constraints
(entity, referential, domain, etc.) while creating the database. You have to also load your
tables with legitimate values. Each table should contain at least 5 tuples.

● Performing queries on the database: You have to implement all the functional
requirements that you mentioned in your phase 1 submission.
There should be at least 2 queries for each kind of operation (insertion, update, selection,
projection) etc. for both modifications and retrievals.

Note: At Least 2 analysis queries (involving the JOIN clause) must be present from the
phase 1 submission.

The first part can be done purely using the MySQL CLI. For the second part, you are expected to
create a Python script that can connect to the database using MySQL. You may not use built in
commands and functions to make queries. In other words, you must write SQL queries to satisfy
each of the functional requirements.
